## Introduction
This is projects of Cloud Computing course. There are four projects.<br>
First project makes us get acquainted with some ```Cloud Services``` like: ```Speech to Text```, ```Natural Language Understanding``` and ```Language Translator```.<br>
Second project makes us get acquainted with ```Docker``` and basics of ```Kubernetes```.<br>
Third project makes us get acquainted with ```Hadoop``` and basics of ```MapReduce```.<br>
Fourth project  makes us get acquainted with ```Docker``` and ```Kubernetes```.

## ðŸ’» First Project
This project makes us get acquainted with some ```Cloud Services``` like: ```Speech to Text```, ```Natural Language Understanding``` and ```Language Translator```. a lightweight backend and frontend should be developed and uploaded on cloud. And then we should use cloud services mentioned earlier in our code. In this project we should develop a website that shows movies and their names, director names, their logos and their comments in four various languages. And also we should be able to add comments and show them to users.<br>

Following tasks done in this project:
> 1.  Developing frontend with Html, JavaScript, CSS
> 2.  Developing backend with Php
> 3.  Deploying codes on a cloud
> 4.  Using cloud services (```Speech to Text```, ```Natural Language Understanding``` and ```Language Translator```)

## ðŸ’» Second Project
This project makes us get acquainted with ```Docker``` and basics of ```Kubernetes```. A lightweight application should be developed and be ```dockerized``` and deployed on kubernetes. The application is about getting the climate situation of a specific region.<br>

Following tasks done in this project:
> 1.  Developing application
> 2.  Write ```Dockerfile``` for written application and ```containerize``` it and push it ```docker hub```
> 3.  Deploy the application on Kubernetes.<br>

Screen shot of the output:<br>

## ðŸ’» Third Project
This project makes us get acquainted with ```Hadoop``` and basics of ```MapReduce```. A hadoop cluster shoud be setup by three Virtual Machines and run map reduce programmes on them. for setup cluster hadoop this [link](https://pnunofrancog.medium.com/how-to-set-up-hadoop-3-2-1-multi-node-cluster-on-ubuntu-20-04-inclusive-terminology-2dc17b1bff19) followed. The dataset used for map reduce application can be downloaded by this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets?select=hashtag_joebiden.csv).<br>

Following tasks done in this project:
> 1.  Setup ```Hadoop Cluster``` by three Virtual Machines
> 2.  Write three map reduce programmes on run them on the cluster with this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets?select=hashtag_joebiden.csv).<br>

Screen shot of one of three map reduce programmes output:<br>

## ðŸ’» Fourth Project
This project makes us get acquainted with ```Docker``` and ```Kubernetes```. A lightweight application should be developed and be ```dockerized``` and deployed on kubernetes. The application is a personal note that we can add notes and observe them and delete them.<br>

Following tasks done in this project:
> 1.  Developing application
> 2.  Write ```Dockerfile``` for written application and ```containerize``` it and push it ```docker hub```
> 3.  Deploy the application on Kubernetes.<br>
> 4.  Write (```ConfigMap```, ```Secret```, ```PV```, ```PVC```, ```Deployment```, ```Service```) files and apply them
> 5.  build a ```HPA``` component that is for ```auto scaling```
> 6.  run database with ```stateful set```
> 7.  implement ```helm chart```
> 8.  write ```docker-compose```<br>
